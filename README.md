### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a QR based software solution for pet tags that allows users to generate QR codes that are embedded with their pet's identity details. This is a cost effective alternative to chipping and Apple Airtags!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full-stack web development and in particular Next.JS & MongoDB
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on just about any web-applications (hmu!)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any cool web frameworks I should be adding to my learning list
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm always willing to help!
